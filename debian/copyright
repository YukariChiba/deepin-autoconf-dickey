    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License

    As a special exception, the Free Software Foundation gives unlimited
    permission to copy, distribute and modify the configure scripts that
    are the output of Autoconf.  You need not follow the terms of the GNU
    General Public License when using or distributing such scripts, even
    though portions of the text of Autoconf appear in them.  The GNU
    General Public License (GPL) does govern all other use of the material
    that constitutes the Autoconf program.
   
    Certain portions of the Autoconf source text are designed to be copied
    (in certain cases, depending on the input) into the output of
    Autoconf.  We call these the "data" portions.  The rest of the Autoconf
    source text consists of comments plus executable code that decides which
    of the data portions to output in any given case.  We call these
    comments and executable code the "non-data" portions.  Autoconf never
    copies any of the non-data portions into its output.
   
    This special exception to the GPL applies to versions of Autoconf
    released by the Free Software Foundation.  When you make and
    distribute a modified version of Autoconf, you may extend this special
    exception to the GPL to apply to your modified version as well, *unless*
    your modified version has the potential to copy into its output some
    of the text that was the non-data portion of the version that you started
    with.  (In other words, unless your change moves or copies text from
    the non-data portions to the data portions.)  If your modification has
    such potential, you must delete any notice of this special exception
    to the GPL from your modified version.
